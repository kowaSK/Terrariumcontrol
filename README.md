Control of an Terrarium


This an Terrarium Control using an Rapberry PI & an ESP 32 Control Board(Programmed via Arduino IDE)

I recoment to Raspian as Opertion System.

You have to install Node Red on the Raspberry Pi also you do need an Mqtt Broker

Also you need an DS 18B20 Tempreture Sensor & an propper Relay board
